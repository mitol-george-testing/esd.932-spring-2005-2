This course features an overall framework for understanding the increasingly networked, flat, flexible and diverse nature of organizations, as well as a close look at the many relevant types of organizations, including regulatory, entrepreneurial, multi-national, and non-governmental non-profit. Key organizational processes, including individual motivation, teamwork, and systems change are featured. The core assignment features a series of industry studies in which students conduct field interviews (in phone or in person) of key stakeholders on a pressing policy challenge in that industry and analyze the impact of organizational factors on policy success.\n",
